Google Chrome Browser Extension to keep a limit on your open tabs.

## Install

Install via [the chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabalot/oakcapkgmnkhiglcimjcbobnloldlcgf?hl=en&gl=US).

## Description

Automatically limit the number of open tabs in chrome.

If you end up with too many tabs open, all reduced to a tiny size, this extension will help you keep those tabs under control. After reaching a configurable open tab limit (that excludes pinned tabs) Tabalot will automatically close the oldest unused tab. As you get close to your tab limit, the extension icon badge count will start to turn red and when it deletes a tab for you it will flash red.

Note that the tab badge count shows tabs in the current open window only (which seems to be a limitation on chrome) but will correctly update as you switch windows.
